# Unlocking Planetary Resources’ Intellectual Property

A decade of innovation, yours to build upon

## Planetary Resources Intellectual Property Pledge

ConsenSys acquired Planetary Resources, a pioneering space company, in October of 2018. Over the course of nearly a decade, Planetary Resources produced innovations at every step along the path to its bold mission of harnessing the natural resources of celestial bodies, from spacecraft design to tools for technical and economic analysis of resources throughout our solar system. Consonant with ConsenSys’ belief in the power of open innovation to solve the toughest challenges, on our planet and beyond, we’re making the Planetary Resources intellectual property we own available to you to build upon, as follows.

ConsenSys irrevocably pledges that it will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing a Planetary Resources Patent or Planetary Resources Intellectual Property, for so long as such party is acting in good faith. The key terms of this pledge are defined below.
A party is "acting in good faith" for so long as such party and its related or affiliated companies have not filed a lawsuit or other legal proceeding for patent or intellectual property infringement, or obtained a direct financial interest in such lawsuit or other legal proceeding, against ConsenSys or any entity controlled by ConsenSys or against any third party based in whole or in part on any product or service developed by or on behalf of ConsenSys or any entity controlled by ConsenSys.
